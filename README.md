MVP:

**asterisks indicate non-MVP extended functionality 

-Three sections of page: 

    1. toolbar/menu of buttons for various lines of code
    
    2. container where code appears and can be edited
    
    3. canvas where code is run
    
    ** built in tutorials (build a car, etc), editor with distibution code
    
-Functionality:

    Menu:
    
        -"blocks" or lines of code to be dropped into editable container
    
        -different sections of blocks depending on user (three part menu)
        
        **blocks colored according to type
        
    Editor:
    
        -new line of code appears according to dropped location
        
        *lines always appear on a new line
        
        *contents are partiallly editable (can't remove paretheses, key words)
        
        **cursor then moves to parameters to motivate completion
        
        **color picker for background and fill blocks
        
        
    Canvas:
        
        - new code is rendered from container when run button is clicked
    
        *new code is rendered dynamically, without needing to click run button
        
        **Similar to khan academy, an error message appears to indicate a mistake in the code
